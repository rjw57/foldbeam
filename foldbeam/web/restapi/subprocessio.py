class SubprocessIOChunker():
    '''
    Processor class wrapping handling of subprocess IO.

    In a way, this is a "communicate()" replacement with a twist.

    - We are multithreaded. Writing in and reading out, err are all sep threads.
    - We support concurrent (in and out) stream processing.
    - The output is not a stream. It's a queue of read string (bytes, not unicode)
      chunks. The object behaves as an iterable. You can "for chunk in obj:" us.
    - We are non-blocking in more respects than communicate()
      (reading from subprocess out pauses when internal buffer is full, but
       does not block the parent calling code. On the flip side, reading from
       slow-yielding subprocess may block the iteration until data shows up. This
       does not block the parallel inpipe reading occurring parallel thread.)

    The purpose of the object is to allow us to wrap subprocess interactions into
    and interable that can be passed to a WSGI server as the application's return
    value. Because of stream-processing-ability, WSGI does not have to read ALL
    of the subprocess's output and buffer it, before handing it to WSGI server for
    HTTP response. Instead, the class initializer reads just a bit of the stream
    to figure out if error ocurred or likely to occur and if not, just hands the
    further iteration over subprocess output to the server for completion of HTTP
    response.

    The real or perceived subprocess error is trapped and raised as one of
    EnvironmentError family of exceptions
