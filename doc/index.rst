The Foldbeam GIS System
-----------------------

Foldbeam provides a convenient visual computing model for performing GIS operations. Foldbeam can either be used
directly in Python programs or can be used as a base for custom GIS applications.

Foldbeam attempts to Do The Right thing in most cases. For the majority of applications where you need to get GIS data
in from multiple sources, merge it and spit it back out, Foldbeam is designed to let you.

.. note::

    Foldbeam is a personal research project at the moment and is not suitable for production use. Check back later as
    the project matures.
